      <p>I started Adolescence on Netflix thinking it would be another show about teenagers figuring life out. I finished it feeling like I had watched something much closer to real life than I expected. Not just their lives, but ours too.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What stayed with me most was how watched everyone felt. Parents watching. Teachers watching. Friends watching. Phones watching. Even when the characters were alone, they were still thinking about how they looked, how they sounded, and how they would be judged. It felt familiar. Growing up today does not really come with privacy. Everything feels visible, and that can be exhausting.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The show made me think about how often teenagers are misunderstood. When someone pulls away, people call it attitude. When someone is angry, it is seen as bad behaviour. Adolescence shows that a lot of this is confusion and overload. The characters are not trying to be difficult. They are trying to survive feelings they do not fully understand yet.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One thing that hit hard was how early the pressure starts. There is this constant expectation to know who you are and where you are going. At the same time, there is very little space to be unsure or to change your mind. Watching the show, it became clear how unfair that is. Adolescence is supposed to be about figuring things out, not having it all together.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The role of social media in the show felt painfully real. The quiet comparison. The pressure to look okay even when you are not. The fear of being left out or misunderstood. The need to perform a version of yourself that feels acceptable. The show does not make this dramatic. It shows it the way it feels. Always in the background, always affecting how you see yourself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What I appreciated most is that Adolescence does not point fingers. It does not say parents are bad or schools are the enemy. Instead, it shows what happens when young people are expected to grow up fast without being emotionally supported. It shows how lonely that can feel, even when you are surrounded by people.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The effects of stigma are far-reaching. Individuals may avoid seeking treatment, leading to worsening symptoms and reduced quality of life. Additionally, stigma can exacerbate feelings of isolation and helplessness, making it even more challenging for individuals to reach out for support. Breaking this cycle of stigma is crucial for encouraging more people to seek help and fostering a supportive environment.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After watching the show, I kept thinking about how often young people are told to be strong instead of being heard. How quickly adults try to fix things instead of listening. How rarely someone asks, “Are you okay?” and waits for an honest answer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Adolescence is uncomfortable to watch at times, but it feels necessary. It reminds us that mental health struggles do not suddenly start later in life. They begin early, often quietly. And they grow when they are ignored.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If there is one thing the show made me realise, it is this. Young people do not need more pressure. They need more understanding. And sometimes, they just need someone to listen without trying to change them.</p>
