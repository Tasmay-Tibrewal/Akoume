                The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, once said, “If you can do something about the problem, then do it. If you can't, then why worry?” This is a profound truth, but we all know that it's easier said than done. Our restless minds have a tendency to wander, diving into the uncertain territories of the future or revisiting the well-trodden paths of the past. While our past teaches us valuable lessons vital for facing the future, an excessive focus on these time frames can build unnecessary anxiety and stress, creating a chronic state of worry.

                While some streets are filled with dhol nagade to celebrate the outstanding performance of some. Scratch that. Few. Most of the streets are filled with angry parents and children. While most of the articles and news channel are talking about the number of students that have qualified from each students few talk about the suicides. While some homes are handing out sweets and receiving flowers for their child's achievement, there are houses who are arranging flowers for their child's demise. 
                <br><br>
                Think about it: the past is a laid-out sheet of experienced time, and the future is a distorted bundle of perceived time. Recognizing that time is a construct of the mind helps us make sense of our experiences and gives sequential purpose to our lives. Without it, we couldn't fathom our circumstances into a coherent entity. Whether it's going about your morning routine or preparing for a job interview, everything is influenced by the long and short-term effects of time on your life. However, there are a few activities that help detach you from this human construct and bring you back to the present.

                <li>Mindful breathing is a powerful way to anchor yourself in the present. In yogic tradition, this is called ‘Pranayama,' and one popular technique follows the 4-7-8 rule. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. Repeat this 7-10 times. This simple practice can calm your mind and reduce anxiety, grounding you firmly in the now.</li>
                <li>When I was young, my father used to engage us in a game where we had to sit quietly and write down the sounds we heard around us. It could be the honking of cars, the rustle of leaves, or even our own breathing. As an architecture student, I've recently developed an interest in observing different materials, textures, and details in my surroundings. This practice is wonderful for grounding your attention in the present environment.</li>
                <li>Every day, dedicate some time to reflect on the things you're grateful for. This practice shifts your focus from what is lacking or worrisome to what is positive and fulfilling in your life right now.</li>

                <strong>Real-Life Examples</strong>
                <br>
                Consider the story of J.K. Rowling, who, before finding success with the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections and lived in relative poverty. Instead of worrying excessively about her uncertain future, she focused on her present task—writing. Her dedication to her craft, despite her circumstances, eventually led to monumental success.

                <strong>Relevance to College Students</strong>
                <br>
                College life, with its pressures and expectations, often amplifies feelings of anxiety about the future or regret over past decisions. Students, remember that you are unique and valuable just as you are. Comparing yourself to others or worrying excessively about grades and careers can detract from the rich experiences and learning opportunities available to you right now.
                <br><br>
                Living in the present doesn't mean ignoring your past or neglecting your future. It means finding a balance where you acknowledge and learn from your past, plan and aspire for your future, but predominantly live and engage with the present. Embrace the present moment and discover the profound impact it can have on your mental well-being. With support, self-awareness, and mindful practices, we can overcome challenges and lead fulfilling lives.
                <br><br>
                Take a deep breath, look around, and appreciate where you are right now. Let's cherish each moment and support each other on this journey. You are not alone, and together, we can face whatever comes our way.
