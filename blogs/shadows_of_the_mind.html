    <p class="blog-meta mt-1">By Adrika Agarwal - Published: 6th July 2024</p>

    <article class="prose text-base mt-2">
      <p>It is said that in the quiet whispers of a newborn's first breath, a sacred bond is forged between heaven and earth. It's said that with every new life, a companion is sent,invisible to all but the one it shadows. These companions, taking various forms, weave their presence into the fabric of our lives, becoming friends, siblings, lovers, and confidants.</p>

      <p>This tale begins with Udbhav, a young boy whose world was forever altered by a terrible car accident. Since then he had always found Bhavya guiding him through life. Initially, Bhaya seemed like a guardian angel, warning Udbhav of potential dangers. But as time passed, Udbhav found himself trapped by Bhaya's constant warnings, unable to move forward and embrace life's joys.</p>

      <p>Then there's Mira, whose companion Ashanka, resembling translucent smoke, was her biggest supporter. With Ashanka's guidance, Mira excelled in her artistic talents, believing in her companion's wisdom. Yet, soon Ashanka began to criticize Mira's every stroke, her confidence decreased, leaving her questioning whether Ashanka was truly a friend or a foe.</p>

      <p>Finally, there's Dev, who is a broker in the stock market. accompanied by Udvega, a relentless reminder of his achievements and obligations. Even in the quiet of night, Udvega's voice keeps reminding him of possible losses, a constant presence that left him feeling burdened and weary.</p>

      <p>Familiar isn't it? Pray tell us, what is your story? We all have that companion, all of us feel the weight of its presence, however it depends on us on how much we let it grow.</p>

      <p>As stated in Chapter 6, Verse 35, of bhagwat geeta Lord Krishna states:<br>
      "asamsayam maha-baho mano durnigraham calam abhyasena tu kaunteya vairagyena ca grhyate"<br>
      Translated, this means:<br>
      "O mighty-armed Arjuna, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and detachment."</p>

      <p>Most of you who are reading this might already know about the rank system. I started with the bottom half in my coaching center. I had excessive performance anxiety during the early stages of my preparation. Therefore I used to cheat a lot during the online tests, which is why I never had self confidence, even during my final paper. About 95% of the people have it. We consider it to be a do or die exam, when in reality it really is not. One exam does not define your entire future.</p>

      <p>Our mind is full of thoughts, and thoughts are like trees. They grow according to how much we care for them, and here lies the catch: we need to pluck out the weeds before they prevent the trees of achievement from growing.</p>

      <p>When we worry that not turning in a single homework assignment is going to destroy our career, or when we get so scared about our loved ones getting hurt whenever they go out, or when we avoid tasks when actually we just want to avoid the failure that might come with it. We may think that all of these are normal, and indeed they are, but to what extent?</p>

      <p>Excessive worrying about daily tasks is what we call general anxiety disorder (GAD) in psychology.</p>

      <p>Imagine waking up every day with a sense of worry that sticks with you no matter what you do. This is what life with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) feels like. It's like having a constant, buzzing alarm in your mind, warning you about work, health, and relationships, even when there's no real danger. This relentless anxiety can leave you feeling restless, tired, and unable to concentrate. Sleep becomes a nightly battle, and your muscles might always feel tense. Living with GAD can be exhausting, but there's always hope. With the right mix of therapy, medication, and lifestyle tweaks, you can turn down the volume on that internal alarm and start enjoying life again.</p>

      <p>Remember, it's all in the mind.</p>
